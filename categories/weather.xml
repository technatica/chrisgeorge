&lt;p&gt;For the past three years we have had thick wildfire smoke as a feature of our summers. This year it is wind and rain and cooler temperatures. The cherries sucked and the birds got ALL of them. I have been watching two robins strip our pin cherries of their bounty. They work hard. At least all of the apple trees had good pollination and seem to be working on a decent crop of apples. So much so that thinning is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the up side the black currants are lovely; fat, juicy, and if not sweet, at least not mind puckeringly tart like they are most years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tomatoes and the basil are struggling a bit. Next year we'll stick some peas in the ground to give us more weather options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cannabis plants, on the other hand, are lovely. This is the first season that we can grow it here legally in Canada. The ones in pots are booming right along and the one in the ground is finally starting to stretch a bit as it digs its roots in. Only a couple of months to wait and we'll see what outdoor grown B.C. bud is like here this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I am still waiting for the smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>ecolocide</category><category>weather</category><guid>https://www.chrisgeorge.ca/posts/summer/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2019 01:47:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Cold</title><link>https://www.chrisgeorge.ca/posts/cold/</link><dc:creator>Chris George</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw it again today on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone was pontificating that global warming had to be bunk because it was cold. Today. Where he lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We really have no problem grasping at straws when those straws are all we have left to support our preconceived notions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>AGW</category><category>weather</category><guid>https://www.chrisgeorge.ca/posts/cold/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 05 Feb 2019 18:19:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Time Flies When You Are Having Summer</title><link>https://www.chrisgeorge.ca/posts/whew-summer/</link><dc:creator>Chris George</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow. It has been a long time since I posted here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no defence. I mean summer was totally flat out busy and I have installed my operating system twice since April but that really isn't a great excuse to not write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I did manage to crank out my &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://infotel.ca/opinion/columnist/chris-george"&gt;column&lt;/a&gt; every Tuesday morning by the deadline. I even wrote a couple of bits for Re:Fiction, a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://refiction.com/team/chris-george"&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; website. (sadly the site has gone in a different direction and turned my article loose)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it is fall. Hopefully this will allow me to get a few more words on the hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>weather</category><category>whimsy</category><guid>https://www.chrisgeorge.ca/posts/whew-summer/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Oct 2018 17:32:01 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
