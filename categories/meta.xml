We go every Saturday to exhange books due for new arrivals. Back in 2009, we eliminated television from our entertainment repertoire and haven't really missed it. The library has been our go to for three year old movies and entire seasons of popular shows, usually a year or so behind the current season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there are the books. I spent a decade reading nothing but non-fiction. When they put me on morphine last year for the back pain (collapsed vertebrae due to multiple myeloma), there was really no point as my comprehension and retention had collapsed. So I switched to fiction and find myself gorging on a decades worth of science fiction and fantasy that is all new to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The library is an anchor in our community. I can't imagine not having such a resource at my fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>information</category><category>meta</category><guid>https://www.chrisgeorge.ca/posts/libraries/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 Feb 2018 23:29:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Welcome.</title><link>https://www.chrisgeorge.ca/posts/welcome/</link><dc:creator>Chris George</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't know how you found yourself here, but welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where I jot down what needs jotting. Don't expect much, it is pretty boring around here. Even the new puppy is sleeping, but then it is -10C outside, so I can't blame her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, poke around if you must. Comment on the bits that are worth a comment if you like. Or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>meta</category><category>philosophy</category><guid>https://www.chrisgeorge.ca/posts/welcome/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2018 17:37:17 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
