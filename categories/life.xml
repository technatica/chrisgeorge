And when you suddenly realize where you are you can't figure out how you got there in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yah, that's me this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The back surgery went great though. Just a month and a bit and I am pretty much fully healed. The chronic pain is seriously diminished and that is great. The down side is that mechanically my body just isn't the same as it used to be. No heavy lifting. No twisting. No bending over. A lifetime of habit to overcome but it is way better than the alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is ice and I can't live with falling down. So I am doing my level best to not do that. And I am working hard to keep it together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>feelin'</category><category>life</category><guid>https://www.chrisgeorge.ca/posts/falling/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 02 Feb 2019 03:12:35 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
