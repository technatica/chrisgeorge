Wow. It has been a long time since I posted here.

I have no defence. I mean summer was totally flat out busy and I have installed my operating system twice since April but that really isn't a great excuse to not write.

And I did manage to crank out my `column <https://infotel.ca/opinion/columnist/chris-george>`_ every Tuesday morning by the deadline. I even wrote a couple of bits for Re:Fiction, a `writing <https://refiction.com/team/chris-george>`_ website. (sadly the site has gone in a different direction and turned my article loose)

Now it is fall. Hopefully this will allow me to get a few more words on the hard drive.
