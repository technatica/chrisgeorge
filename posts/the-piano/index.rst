This past Christmas, we got online courses from `Udemy <http://www.udemy.com/>`_ for everyone. Daughter got a drawing course, son got game programming. Samara got a singing harmony course and I chose a "Learn to Play the Piano" course.

So I started in to it. And discovered that I **like** playing piano. Of course I am only a couple of weeks into the program and things could change once I move past the finger exercises and start reading the music.
