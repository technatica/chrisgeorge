A while back I wrote a review of John Truby's book, "The Anatomy of Story".

It is finally time to put what I learned from it to work. I am diving in to writing a novel, which will be novel for me. All of my published work to date has been non-fiction, mainly political op-ed and software reviews.

This should be interesting.
