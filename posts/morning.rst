One of my favorite things is to get up early, before anyone else is stirring, to sip my coffee and enjoy the peace and quiet. It is even better in the winter, as holing up in the office to check the news keeps me warm and able to look out the window into the piercing cold.

What is new is the puppy. She doesn't sleep in, ruining the peace and quiet part. Luckily, she is pretty smart and is learning that not much exciting goes on around here until the kids get up.
