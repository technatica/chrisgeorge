I don't know how you found yourself here, but welcome.

This is where I jot down what needs jotting. Don't expect much, it is pretty boring around here. Even the new puppy is sleeping, but then it is -10C outside, so I can't blame her.

Well, poke around if you must. Comment on the bits that are worth a comment if you like. Or not.
