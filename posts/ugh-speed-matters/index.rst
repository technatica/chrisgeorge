Remember me commenting on how many things don't work on the internet without high-speed?

One thing I wasn't counting on was something as simple as file transfer.

Yesterday I was puttering around on my computer and decided to install a text editor I had read about. One of the prerequisites was QScintilla2. So using pip, I went to install it. Unfortunately, pip pulled in PyQT5 as a prerequisite for QScintilla2. And that broke my "real" text editor, the one I have been using for over a decade and had all of my automation for this blog. It also cut me off from the rest of my "in progress" writing.

So I started troubleshooting, with an eye to restoring my machine to where it was before the offending package landed. I removed it, but when I went to install the proper version, the server with the files kept timing out on the downloads. The server assumed that my computer had given up and terminated the download after a couple of minutes.

Frustration mounted, driving me to pack up the laptop, drive to the library and fix the problem.

3/4 of a gigabyte of downloading later, I had my editor (`Leo <http://www.leoeditor.com/>`_) back up and running. I also updated my system and downloaded fresh code for Leo.

All is well. Maybe I will even get in some writing before daughter comes home from school.
